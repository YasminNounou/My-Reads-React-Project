# MyReads Project

This project provides an app for books with categories "Continue Reading","To Read", "Read" that are viewed on the main page of the user's.
The user can click on the "+" button to search for books and add them to 

## Component Architecture
I've added **5** components `App.js` which is the main root ,`Shelves.js` to list the categoris of shelves then pass to `Shelf.js` that list each books in each shelf &  `Book.js` that list the book along with drop down menu . 
`Search.js` is responsible for searching ofr the required or matching books found in the server



## Instructions

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* also you might need to install React-Router in your directory `npm install --save react-router-dom`

    ├── App.js # This is the root of the app.
    ├── App.test.js # Used for testing. Provided with Create React App. Testing is encouraged, but not required.
    ├── BooksAPI.js # A JavaScript API for the provided Udacity backend. Instructions for the methods are below.
    ├── icons # Helpful images for your app. Use at your discretion.

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

TThe provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods  to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
    ├──  eturns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
   ├──  This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

* [`update`](#update)
├──  book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
├── shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
├── Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

* [`search`](#search)
├──  query: `<String>`
├──  maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
├── Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
├── These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
